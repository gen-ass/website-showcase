 Providing a simple and clear layout to users provides context to understand the purpose and goal of the site at one glance. If 
 the site provides clarity at first glance then you achieve engagement early. A user will more likely navigate and read through 
 your site. Simplicity and clarity of the layout will assist in conveying meaning. Each feature will be supportive of the 
 global purpose of the site, that is the author displays their skills to the audience. The audience can be interested in the    
 technology utilised, can be looking for help with their projects, can be general user seeking advice. Providing a display of t
 the skills and projects completed and the ability to contact the author will achieve the main goal of the site.
